# oci-quickstart-h2o
This is a Terraform module that deploys [H2O.ai Driverless AI](https://www.h2o.ai/products/) on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/cloud-infrastructure).  It is developed jointly by Oracle and H2O.ai. For instructions on how to use this material and details on getting support from the vendor that maintains this material, please contact them directly.

Instructions on how to use it are below.  In addition, here's a video walkthrough:

## Prerequisites
First off you'll need to do some pre deploy setup.  That's all detailed [here](https://github.com/oracle/oci-quickstart-prerequisites).

DAI requires a license key. If you don't already have a key, you can get a [trial key](https://www.h2o.ai/try-driverless-ai/). You can deploy these templates before you get a key, but you'll be prompted for a key at first login.

## Clone the Module
Now, you'll want a local copy of this repo. You can make that with the commands:

    git clone https://github.com/oracle/oci-quickstart-h2o.git
    cd oci-quickstart-h2o/terraform
    ls

That should give you this:

We now need to initialize the directory with the module in it.  This makes the module aware of the OCI provider.  You can do this by running:

    terraform init

This gives the following output:

![](./images/02%20-%20terraform%20init.png)

## Deploy
Now for the main attraction.  Let's make sure the plan looks good:

    terraform plan

That gives:

![](./images/03%20-%20terraform%20plan.png)

The next command will deploy H2O DAI using the values in the `variables.tf` file:
- `key`: Set to the value of your key. If empty, you will be prompted to enter your key at first login.
- `shape`: Default `BM.GPU2.2`, these templates support both CPU and GPU (higher performance) shapes.
- `ad_number`: Default `0`, choose a value where you have *quota* for the desired shape.
- `disk_size_gb`: Default `0`, size of block volume in GB for data, min 50. If set to 0 volume will not be created/mounted
- `user`: Default `admin`, these templates set up local authentication using file `/etc/dai/htpasswd`
- `password`: Default `admin`

If that's good, we can go ahead and apply the deploy:

    terraform apply

You'll need to enter `yes` when prompted.  The apply should take about seven minutes to run.  Once complete, you'll see something like this:

![](./images/04%20-%20terraform%20apply.png)

When the `apply` is complete, the infrastructure will be deployed, but the cloud-init scripts will still be running.  Those will wrap up asynchronously.  So, it'll be a few more minutes before your DAI instance is accessible.  Now is a good time to get a coffee.

## Connect to DAI

The `apply` prints the URL of H2O Driverless AI when it completes.  The deployment creates a self-signed certificate, so you'll need to confirm the exception.

Logging into that we see:

![](./images/05%20-%20agreement.png)

After accepting the agreement, we can see the login screen. Use the login defined in the `variables.tf` file:

![](./images/06%20-%20login.png)

The documentation [here](http://docs.h2o.ai/driverless-ai/latest-stable/docs/userguide/launching.html) provides a walkthrough and some good next steps.  There are a bunch of public data sets to get you started.  Here's an example of an experiment I set up on one using that walkthrough.

![](./images/07%20-%20experiment.png)

## SSH to the Instance
This machine is using Oracle Linux (OL).  The default login is opc.  You can SSH into the machine with a command like this:

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/oci opc@<Public IP Address>

![](./images/08%20-%20ssh.png)

H2O is installed under `/opt/h2o`.  Logs from the install are under `/var/log/messages` and viewable with root privileges.

## View DAI in the Console
You can also login to the web console [here](https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/a/compute/instances) to view the IaaS that is running DAI.

## Destroy the Deployment
When you no longer need the deployment, you can run this command to destroy it:

    terraform destroy

You'll need to enter `yes` when prompted.  Once complete, you'll see something like this:

![](./images/10%20-%20terraform%20destroy.png)
